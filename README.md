Predicting car fares based on historical data on car trips. In this problem we are given a training set of 16067 taxi trips in the train data and 9914 records in the test data. The goal of this challenge is to predict the fare of a taxi trip given information about the pickup and drop off locations, the pickup date time and number of passengers travelling.
